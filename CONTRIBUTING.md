```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8, use Black for formatting
- **Documentation:** Clear docstrings for all public APIs
- **Comments:** Explain complex algorithms and security considerations
- **Naming:** Descriptive variable and function names

### Git Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-improvement`
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m "Add amazing improvement"`
4. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-improvement`
5. **Submit** a Pull Request

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
```
feat: add support for mobile devices
fix: resolve gossip protocol timeout issue  
docs: update API documentation
test: add security vulnerability tests
refactor: optimize federated averaging algorithm
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Ensure tests pass:** All existing tests must continue to pass
2. **Add tests:** New features should include appropriate tests
3. **Update docs:** Update README and API documentation as needed
4. **Security review:** Security-related changes require additional review
5. **Performance check:** Benchmark performance-critical changes

## üîí Security Considerations

### Reporting Security Issues
**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
- Email: security@neural-dust-network.org
- Include: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, potential impact
- Response time: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### Security Guidelines for Contributors
- **Never commit private keys or secrets**
- **Use secure random number generation**
- **Validate all inputs from network peers**
- **Follow cryptographic best practices**
- **Consider timing attack vulnerabilities**

### Code Review for Security
All security-related code requires review by at least two maintainers with cryptography expertise.

## üìñ Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```python
def secure_broadcast_delta(self, model_state_dict, epoch=None):
    """
    Broadcast a cryptographically signed model delta.
    
    Args:
        model_state_dict (dict): PyTorch model state dictionary
        epoch (int, optional): Epoch number for ordering. Defaults to current timestamp.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if broadcast successful, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        SecurityError: If signing fails or delta exceeds size limit
        
    Security Notes:
        - All deltas are signed with Ed25519 private key
        - Delta size is limited to prevent DoS attacks
        - Timestamps prevent replay attacks
    """
```

### API Documentation
- Use clear, concise descriptions
- Include code examples for complex features
- Document security implications
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests:** Component interaction
3. **Security Tests:** Cryptographic correctness, attack resistance
4. **Performance Tests:** Benchmarks and resource usage
5. **End-to-End Tests:** Full system scenarios

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum:** 80% code coverage for new features
- **Security code:** 95% coverage required
- **Critical paths:** 100% coverage for core algorithms

### Writing Good Tests
```python
def test_federated_averaging_convergence():
    """Test that federated averaging converges to expected result."""
    # Arrange
    models = create_test_models(num_models=5, divergence=0.1)
    
    # Act
    averaged_model = federated_average(models)
    
    # Assert
    assert model_convergence_metric(averaged_model, models) < 0.05
    assert all(param.requires_grad for param in averaged_model.parameters())
```
